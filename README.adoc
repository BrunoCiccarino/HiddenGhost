== DantesGhost

Dante's Ghost is an lkm rootkit with support for 5.7x kernels + which hooks the *syscall table finding the kallsyms_lockup_name* with the ```<linux/kprobes.h>``` headder.

Before starting the explanation of how the rootkit works in depth I will explain the basics.

What is Hooking:

Hooking is the act of redirecting/modifying a certain code stream, this redirect technique can be used for good and for bad, a big example of using this technique is mid function hooking This time I saw an example midFunction hook in the Unknown cheats forum that created a function ```jmp 0xE9``` at address ```pAddres``` I won't take much of your time explaining how it works and such because there are articles about it, I left two articles at the end of this readme, mine where I explain in depth about lkm and the one about MidFunction hook.
